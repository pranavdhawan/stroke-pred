# stroke-prediction

## Inspiration

Good Health and Well-being being one of the **UN SDGs**, I wanted to create a project in this field, which would help users with possible notions of a future heart stroke. They could first go through the first in hand diagnosis by themselves without consulting a doctor. I was going through some Kaggle Datasets and I came across a **Stroke Prediction Dataset.** ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pranavdhawan/stroke-prediction-model-lr/data)) Since I'm new to Machine Learning, I decided to practice my ML skills with it. 
This project will not count to be 100% accurate and a patient should always seek medical consultation.

## What it does

This project takes a user's cardiac related parameters and predict weather they are likely to have a Stroke.

## How I built it

I used Logistic Regression Machine Learning algorithm to train the dataset into a model, and used Flask to shape this into a Web App using HTML, CSS.
